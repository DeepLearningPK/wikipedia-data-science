(Eds.) (2009). Dictionary of Human Geography (5th Ed.), Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; His usage was a reference to the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]], the commoners of France who, before and during the [[French Revolution]], opposed the clergy and nobles, who composed the First Estate and Second Estate, respectively. Sauvy wrote, &quot;This third world ignored, exploited, despised like the third estate also wants to be something.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Literal translation from French&lt;/ref&gt; He conveyed the concept of political [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] with either the capitalist or communist bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie (1987). &quot;Why 'Third World'?: Origin, Definition and Usage&quot;, ''Third World Quarterly'', 9(4): 1311-1327.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\",\n",

       " b\"The term &quot;'''Third World'''&quot;  arose during the [[Cold War]] to define countries that remained non-aligned with either [[NATO]] or the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]]. The [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Western Europe]]an nations and their allies represented the [[First World]], while the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]], [[Cuba]], and their allies represented the [[Second World]]. This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political and economic divisions. Since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the [[end of the Cold War]], the term ''Third World'' has been used less and less. It is being replaced with terms such as [[Developing country|developing countries]], [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] or the [[Global South]]. The concept itself has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world.\\n\",\n",

       " b'The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with [[Colonization|colonial]] pasts in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Asia]]. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In the [[dependency theory]] of thinkers like [[Ra\\xc3\\xbal Prebisch]], [[Walter Rodney]], Theotonio dos Santos, and [[Andre Gunder Frank]], the Third World has also been connected to the [[World-systems theory|world-systemic]] economic division as [[periphery countries|&quot;periphery&quot; countries]] dominated by the countries comprising the [[core countries|economic &quot;core&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomlinson&quot;/&gt;\\n',\n",

Because many Third World countries were economically poor and non-industrialized, it became a [[stereotype]] to refer to poor countries as &quot;third world countries&quot;, yet the &quot;Third World&quot; term is also often taken to include [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]] like Brazil, India, and China; they are now more commonly referred to as part of [[BRIC]].

The large diversity of countries considered part of the Third World \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from Indonesia to Afghanistan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ranged widely from economically primitive to economically advanced and from politically non-aligned to {{nowrap begin}}Soviet-{{nowrap end}} or Western-leaning.

The term has been reified in a way that, for some camps in the always-splintering Left, directly highlights the nature of the problem and who is collectively causing it.  In current parlance, it no longer means &quot;you people who haven't picked a side yet&quot; at all, and is compatible with non-thought-policing, classical-liberal politics.

By the time I graduated high school in the mid-1980s, few of my generation thought of the Third World in terms of those places caught between communism (which was already seen as dying bear) vs. capitalism, but as that part of the world getting the short end of the stick from Old World aristocracy and innate superiority thinking, and the New World one-hand-giveth approach of promising democracy and reform and running off with all the loot (and maybe bombing you if you complain).\\n\",\n",

It tells of the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. Director [[David Lynch]] and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], who declined to return as Laura's best friend [[Donna Hayward]] and was replaced by [[Moira Kelly]], and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Also, [[Kyle MacLachlan]] returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes. Most of the deleted scenes feature additional characters from the television series who ultimately did not appear in the finished film.

I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me they really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper/BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene).&quot; Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of ''Twin Peaks'' in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twinpeaksarchive.blogspot.com/2007/07/exclusive-matt-haley-interview.html |title=Exclusive Matt Haley interview! |publisher=Twin Peaks Archive |date=July 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\",\n",
