The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.

As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net|accessdate=30 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625232340/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Woodcock states that &quot;a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis\\xc3\\xa9e Reclus and Louise Michel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;\\n\",\n",

       " b\"A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and Albert Meltzer manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer.

The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\",\n",

The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Jeffrey P.|title=Autism at 70 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Redrawing the Boundaries|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=19 September 2013|volume=369|issue=12|pages=1089\\xe2\\x80\\x931091|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1306380|pmid=24047057}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n',\n",

Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like [[nutmeg]] or [[coriander]], but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by [[citric acid|citric]] or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola\\'s recipe]] is maintained as a corporate [[trade secret]]. \\n \\n A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized [[Maize|corn]]. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas. < ref > {{cite book |editor1=M.
